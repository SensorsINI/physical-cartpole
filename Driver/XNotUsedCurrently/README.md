# XNotUsedCurrently

This folder collects various files which were present in the project at some point,
but are either obsolete or not used for a long time and are not an integral part of current project.
Use them in caution.
You can try to search old git revision to find a configuration in which they are working

`Example.m` and `Pendulum.m` are matlab files which seemingly could be used
to communicate with CartPole firmware (which release?).

`stream.py` and `stream_file.py` are the python scripts to set parameters of firmware controller.
Simple files, no PC controller. 

`control.sh` not clear for what this file is useful.
